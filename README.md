## Usage
### Train
* Train data is located in "*<U>SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_training/TRAIN_FILE.TXT*</U>".
* "[glove.6B.100d](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)" is used as pre-trained glove model.
* Performance (accuracy and f1-socre) outputs during training are **NOT OFFICIAL SCORE** of *SemEval 2010 Task 8*. To compute the official performance, you should proceed the follow [Evaluation](#evaluation) step with checkpoints obtained by training.

##### Display help message:
```bash
$ python train.py --help
```
##### Train Example:
```bash
$ python train.py --embedding_path "glove.6B.100d.txt"
```

### Evaluation
* You can get an **OFFICIAL SCORE** of *SemEval 2010 Task 8* for test data by following this step. [README](SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_scorer-v1.2/README.txt) describes how to evaluate the official score.
* Test data is located in "<U>*SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_testing_keys/TEST_FILE_FULL.TXT*</U>".
* **MUST GIVE `--checkpoint_dir` ARGUMENT**, checkpoint directory from training run, like below example.

##### Evaluation Example:
```bash
$ python eval.py --checkpoint_dir "runs/1523902663/checkpoints/"
```

## SemEval-2010 Task #8
* Given: a pair of *nominals*
* Goal: recognize the semantic relation between these nominals.
* Example:
	* "There were apples, **<U>pears</U>** and oranges in the **<U>bowl</U>**." 
		<br> → *CONTENT-CONTAINER(pears, bowl)*
	* “The cup contained **<U>tea</U>** from dried **<U>ginseng</U>**.” 
		<br> → *ENTITY-ORIGIN(tea, ginseng)*


### The Inventory of Semantic Relations
1. *Cause-Effect(CE)*: An event or object leads to an effect(those cancers were caused by radiation exposures)
2. *Instrument-Agency(IA)*: An agent uses an instrument(phone operator)
3. *Product-Producer(PP)*: A producer causes a product to exist (a factory manufactures suits)
4. *Content-Container(CC)*: An object is physically stored in a delineated area of space (a bottle full of honey was weighed) Hendrickx, Kim, Kozareva, Nakov, O S´ eaghdha, Pad ´ o,´ Pennacchiotti, Romano, Szpakowicz Task Overview Data Creation Competition Results and Discussion The Inventory of Semantic Relations (III)
5. *Entity-Origin(EO)*: An entity is coming or is derived from an origin, e.g., position or material (letters from foreign countries)
6. *Entity-Destination(ED)*: An entity is moving towards a destination (the boy went to bed) 
7. *Component-Whole(CW)*: An object is a component of a larger whole (my apartment has a large kitchen)
8. *Member-Collection(MC)*: A member forms a nonfunctional part of a collection (there are many trees in the forest)
9. *Message-Topic(CT)*: An act of communication, written or spoken, is about a topic (the lecture was about semantics)
10. *OTHER*: If none of the above nine relations appears to be suitable.
